    website by us to you.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>2. Our Contract</h3>
    Your order is an offer to us to buy the product(s) in your order. When you place
    an order to purchase a product from us, you will receive an e-mail confirming
    receipt of your order and containing the details of your order (the "Order
    Confirmation E-mail"). The Order Confirmation E-mail is acknowledgement that we
    have received your order, and does not confirm acceptance of your offer to buy
    the product(s) ordered. We only accept your offer, and conclude the contract of
    sale for a product ordered by you, when the product is dispatched to you and an
    e-mail confirmation is sent to you that the product has been dispatched to you
    (the "Dispatch Confirmation E-mail"). If your order is dispatched in more than
    one package, you may receive a separate Dispatch Confirmation E-mail for each
    package, and each Dispatch Confirmation E-mail and corresponding dispatch will
    conclude a separate contract of sale between you and us for the product(s) specified
    in that Dispatch Confirmation E-mail.
    <br>
    Your contract is with us (the Sellers) and you confirm that the product(s) ordered
    by you are purchased for your internal / personal purpose and not for re-sale or
    business purpose. You authorize us to declare and provide declaration to any
    governmental authority on your behalf stating the aforesaid purpose of the products
    ordered by you on the website.
    <br>
    You can cancel your order for a product at no cost any time before we send the
    Dispatch Confirmation E-mail relating to that product.
    <br>
    Please note that we sell products only in quantities which correspond to the
    typical needs of an average household. This applies both to the number of products
    ordered within a single order and the placing of several orders for the same
    product where the individual orders comprise a quantity typical for a normal
    household.
